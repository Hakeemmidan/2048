# Background and Overview
2048 is a game where you could move square blocks around a contained grid. Once two square of the same value touch, then their values would sum and become one square. The goal of the game is to reach a square that has a value of 2048. All the squares are of even numbers.

This game was originally made by Gabriele Cirulli. You can play it [here](https://play2048.co). This is a clone of it that I am doing to practice HTML5 Canvas.
